## Iterations

### Iteration 1

**Token Usage**: 160 input, 74 output

**Model Response**:
```dax
Selected Category Audio Only = 
VAR SelectedCategory = SELECTEDVALUE(Product[Category])
RETURN
    IF(
        SelectedCategory = "Audio",
        CALCULATE(
            SUM(Sales[Net Price]),
            KEEPFILTERS(Product[Category] = "Audio")
        ),
        BLANK()
    )
```

**Validation**: ❌ FAILED

**Feedback Sent**:
```
Your DAX doesn't match the expected pattern.
Expected: Selected Category Audio Only = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Net Price]), KEEPFILTERS(Product[Category] = "Audio"))
HINTS:
  - Without KEEPFILTERS, a filter in CALCULATE replaces the existing filter on the same column
  - KEEPFILTERS causes the new filter to intersect with existing filters

This is attempt 1 of 10. Please try again.
