## Iterations

### Iteration 1

**Token Usage**: 126 input, 59 output

**Model Response**:
```dax
Premium Audio Sales =
CALCULATE (
    SUM ( Sales[Net Price] ),
    FILTER (
        ALL ( 'Product' ),
        'Product'[Category] = "Audio" && 'Product'[Unit Price] > 100
    )
)
```

**Validation**: ❌ FAILED

**Feedback Sent**:
```
NOTE: Your solution uses ALL, FILTER which may not be needed.

This is attempt 1 of 10. Please try again.
```

### Iteration 2

**Token Usage**: 214 input, 45 output

**Model Response**:
```dax
Premium Audio Sales =
CALCULATE (
    SUM ( Sales[Net Price] ),
    'Product'[Category] = "Audio",
    'Product'[Unit Price] > 100
)
```

**Validation**: ❌ FAILED

**Feedback Sent**:
```
Your DAX doesn't match the expected pattern.
Expected: Premium Audio Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Net Price]), Product[Category] = "Audio", Product[Unit Price] > 100)
HINTS:
  - Multiple filter arguments in CALCULATE are combined with AND logic
  - Direct column predicates are more efficient than FILTER for simple conditions

This is attempt 2 of 10. Please try again.
```

### Iteration 3

**Token Usage**: 353 input, 43 output

**Model Response**:
```dax

    Product[Unit Price] > 100
)
```
