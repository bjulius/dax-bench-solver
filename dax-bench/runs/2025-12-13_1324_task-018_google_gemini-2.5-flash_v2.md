## Iterations

### Iteration 1

**Token Usage**: 110 input, 50 output

**Model Response**:
```dax
= RANKX(
    CALCULATETABLE(
        Product,
        ALLEXCEPT(Product, Product[Category])
    ),
    Product[Unit Price],
    ,
    DESC,
    SKIP
)
```

**Validation**: ❌ FAILED

**Feedback Sent**:
```
Your DAX doesn't match the expected pattern.
Expected: Category Rank by Price = COUNTROWS(FILTER(Product, Product[Category] = EARLIER(Product[Category]) && Product[Unit Price] > EARLIER(Product[Unit Price]))) + 1
HINTS:
  - EARLIER references the value from an outer row context
  - Count how many products in the same category have a higher price

This is attempt 1 of 10. Please try again.
```

### Iteration 2

**Token Usage**: 266 input, 51 output

**Model Response**:
```dax
[Category] = EARLIER(Product[Category]) && Product[Unit Price] > EARLIER(Product[Unit Price])
    )
) + 1
```

**Validation**: ❌ FAILED

**Feedback Sent**:
```
MEASURE NAME: Expected 'Category Rank by Price', got 'Category'
HINT: The expected solution uses these functions you might be missing: FILTER

This is attempt 2 of 10. Please try again.
