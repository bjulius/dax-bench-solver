### Iteration 6 [Enhanced Feedback]

**Tokens**: 572 in, 56 out

**Generated DAX**:
```dax

    )
)
```

**Result**: ❌ Failed

**Feedback sent**:
```
Additional hints:
  - Multiple filter arguments in CALCULATE are combined with AND logic
  - Direct column predicates are more efficient than FILTER for simple conditions
The solution starts with CALCULATE()

This is attempt 6/10 (Enhanced feedback mode)
